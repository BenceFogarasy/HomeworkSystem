# HomeworkSystem
A homework sorting system for personal use.


This system was based on a YouTube series detailing the making of a webserver in NodeJs.
It uses GET and POST requests to communicate between the client and server to store the data in a database. 
The client side uses *asycnhronous functions* to take full advantage of the power of JavaScript.
